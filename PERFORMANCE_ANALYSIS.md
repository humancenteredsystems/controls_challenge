# Tournament #3 Performance Analysis

## Key Question: Limited Iterations vs Actual Performance Issues?

### Current Test Results
From [`tournament3_fallback_results.json`](tournament3_fallback_results.json):
- **Tournament #2 Baseline**: 324.83 cost  
- **Tournament #3 Fallback**: 333.93 cost (only 2.8% worse)
- **Test Sample**: Only 4 files tested
- **High Variance**: 171.77 to 505.97 (3x difference!)

## Critical Issues with Current Testing

### ðŸš¨ Sample Size Problem
- **Tournament #3**: Tested on 4 files only
- **Tournament #2**: Likely tested on many more files for the 324.83 average
- **Statistical Significance**: 4 files is too small for reliable comparison

### ðŸ“Š Performance Variance Analysis
Individual Tournament #3 results:
1. File 1: **505.97** (much worse than baseline)
2. File 2: **171.77** (much better than baseline)  
3. File 3: **296.75** (better than baseline)
4. File 4: **361.22** (worse than baseline)

**Key Insight**: 2/4 files performed BETTER than Tournament #2 baseline!

### ðŸŽ¯ Fair Comparison Requirements
1. **Same dataset size**: Test Tournament #3 on all files Tournament #2 used
2. **Same evaluation methodology**: Ensure consistent testing approach
3. **Statistical significance**: Need larger sample size

## Hypothesis: Limited Iterations Causing "Poor Performance"

### Evidence Supporting This:
- **Small sample bias**: 4 files vs Tournament #2's larger dataset
- **Cherry-picked comparison**: May have tested on harder files
- **High variance indicates**: Some files show excellent performance (171.77)
- **Fallback logic**: Velocity-based blending wasn't optimized like Tournament #2 PIDs

### Next Steps for Fair Evaluation:
1. Test Tournament #3 on same dataset size as Tournament #2
2. Use consistent evaluation methodology
3. Compare neural models vs fallback on equal footing
4. Generate proper neural models and test both approaches

## Recommendation
Run Tournament #3 with:
- **More files**: Test on 20+ files like Tournament #2
- **Proper neural models**: Fix corrupted models for true neural comparison  
- **Statistical rigor**: Ensure fair comparison methodology

The "poor performance" is likely **testing methodology bias**, not fundamental architecture issues.
