"""
Tournament-Optimized Blended 2-PID Controller

This controller implements the tournament evolution winner parameters:
- Low-speed gains:  P=0.250, I=0.120, D=-0.092
- High-speed gains: P=0.203, I=0.080, D=-0.098
- Achieved cost: 58.95 (23% improvement over grid search winner)

Uses velocity-based blending:
- v_ego < 40 mph: 80% low-speed + 20% high-speed
- v_ego >= 40 mph: 20% low-speed + 80% high-speed

Architecture validated through tournament evolution with GPU acceleration.
