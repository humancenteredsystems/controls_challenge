Following the successful Tournament #2 optimization, Tournament #3 introduced an advanced neural blending system that combines PID control with learned neural network weights. While the technical infrastructure is fully operational, current performance shows regression that requires optimization.

#### 📊 Tournament #3 Performance Results (100-file validation)

| Metric | Tournament #3 | Tournament #2 | Delta | Status |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Average Cost** | 566.33 | 324.83 | -241.50 | ❌ **74% REGRESSION** |
| **Median Cost** | 289.89 | 324.83 | +34.94 | ✅ **11% IMPROVEMENT** |
| **Standard Deviation** | 905.62 | ~50-100 | High variance | ❌ **INCONSISTENT** |
| **Success Rate** | 56% | N/A | Better than baseline | ⚠️ **MIXED RESULTS** |

#### 🔍 Key Performance Insights

**✅ Technical Infrastructure Success:**
- 43 working neural models (1,199 bytes each) with GPU acceleration
- CUDAExecutionProvider active and functioning correctly
- Robust error handling with automatic Tournament #2 parameter fallback

2. **Real Driving Data**: Replace synthetic patterns with actual driving scenarios
3. **Outlier Management**: Enhanced edge case handling in training pipeline
4. **Statistical Validation**: Larger dataset validation for robust performance

#### 🏗️ Neural Blending Architecture
