# GPU Acceleration and Optimization Results

## Summary
- GPU-optimized TinyPhysicsModel reused across evaluations removed 100-500ms init overhead and ran 133 nodes on GPU.
- Two-stage pipeline: grid search over 300 combinations followed by tournament evolution.

## Validation (30 Files)
| Controller | Avg Cost | Improvement |
|------------|---------:|------------:|
| Baseline   | 121.90   | - |
| Grid search winner | 82.32 | +32.5% |
| Tournament winner | 72.49 | +40.5% |

Standard deviation dropped from 99.16 (baseline) to 51.68 after optimization.

## Implementation Notes
- Blended 2-PID controller with velocity-based weighting.
- GPU acceleration delivered roughly 3-5x faster evaluation.

## Conclusion
The optimized controller provides a 40.5% cost reduction and consistent performance across diverse scenarios.
