# Next Steps Optimization Analysis

Current tournament optimizer uses GPU acceleration and achieves a 41.6% cost reduction, but variance remains high at 98.

## Key Gaps
1. **Variance crisis** – wide performance spread with P90 at 150.7.
2. **Evolutionary plateau** – only 11.4% gain over grid search.
3. **Parameter space inefficiency** – best scenarios not found consistently.

## Strategic Opportunities
- **Multi-objective tournament** combining average and variance for robust scoring.
- **Adaptive search focusing** using archive analysis and biased sampling.
- **Scenario-aware optimization** with specialized controllers per driving context.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (1–2 wks):** implement robust tournament, target std <60.
- **Phase 2 (3–4 wks):** adaptive search to push avg cost to 55–70.
- **Phase 3 (4–6 wks):** scenario-aware architecture aiming for avg cost <45 with std <25.

Achieving these steps unlocks consistent sub‑45 performance within a few months.
